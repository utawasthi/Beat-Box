# Beat-Box
A Beatbox project built with JavaScript, featuring buttons that trigger audio clips downloaded from the web. Each button uses event listeners for sounds on click or keypress, creating an interactive audio experience. This project highlights JavaScript event handling and audio integration in a fun, creative way.
